Hello! This is a nifty little study helper thing that I coded to streamline my study process. When you run the program, it'll open a nice youtube video with relaxing music. 

Following Jun Yuh's Guide to Academic Success, I've also made it so that every 3-5 minute there will be an alarm (birds chirping) to notify you to take a quick space out break (this is proven to help with retention). It also features an extended pomodoro technique in which every 45 minutes it'll prompt you to take a 15 minute break. During this period, no alarms will sound.
